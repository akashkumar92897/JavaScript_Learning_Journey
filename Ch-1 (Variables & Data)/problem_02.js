//Create a variable of type string and try to add a number to it.
let str = "Akash"
let n = 20;

let ans = str + n;

console.log(ans);
//Akash20  ---> Because JavaScript performs implicit type coercion, converting the number to a string when using + with a string, resulting in string concatenation.
